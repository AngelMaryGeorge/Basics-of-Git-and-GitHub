# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. 
It allows developers to work together on projects from anywhere in the world. 
GitHub uses Git, the distributed version control system, to keep track of changes to code.

## Key Features of GitHub

- **Repositories**: A repository (or "repo") is a project that contains multiple files and folders. It's where your project lives on GitHub.
- **Branches**: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
- **Pull Requests**: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. They provide a way to review and discuss code before it becomes part of the main project.
- **Issues**: Issues are used to track bugs, enhancements, and other tasks. They can be assigned to team members, labeled, and organized into milestones.
- **Projects**: Projects help you organize and prioritize your work. You can create kanban-style boards to track the progress of issues and pull requests.

## Why Use GitHub?

- **Collaboration**: GitHub makes it easy for multiple people to work on a project. You can track changes, discuss issues, and review code collaboratively.
- **Community**: GitHub is home to millions of open-source projects. You can explore, contribute to, and learn from a vast range of projects.
- **Integration**: GitHub integrates with many tools and services, such as CI/CD pipelines, project management tools, and more.
- **Documentation**: GitHub provides a platform for creating comprehensive documentation for your projects, including README files, wikis, and GitHub Pages.

## Basic Concepts

- **Repository**: A storage space on GitHub for your project. It contains all of your projectâ€™s files and the revision history.
- **Fork**: A personal copy of someone else's repository. You can make changes to your fork and propose changes to the original repository via pull requests.
- **Clone**: A local copy of a repository. You can clone a repository to your computer to work on it locally.
- **Pull Request**: A request to merge your changes into another branch or repository. It's a key feature for collaborative development.
