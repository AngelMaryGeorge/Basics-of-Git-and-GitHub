# Common Git Issues and Solutions

## Objectives

- Identify common issues encountered when using Git
- Learn solutions and best practices to resolve these issues

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. Undoing Changes

Issue: You want to undo the last commit but keep the changes in the working directory.

Solution:
```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
This command resets the current branch to the previous commit but keeps your changes staged.

### 2. Discarding Local Changes

Issue: You want to discard all local changes and start fresh.

Solution:
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD
```
This command will discard all local changes and reset the working directory to match the latest commit.

### 3. Recovering Deleted Branch

Issue: You accidentally deleted a branch.

Solution:
```sh
git reflog
```
Find the commit hash for the deleted branch, then recreate it:

```sh
git checkout -b <branch_name> <commit_hash>
```

### 4. Resolving Merge Conflicts

Issue: Merge conflicts occur when merging branches.

Solution:

Open the conflicting files and resolve conflicts manually.

After resolving conflicts, stage the resolved files:

```sh
git add <resolved_file>
```

Commit the resolved merge:
sh
Copy code
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

### 5. Detached HEAD State

Issue: You are in a detached HEAD state.

Solution:
```sh
git checkout <branch_name>
```
This command will switch back to the branch and leave the detached HEAD state.

### 6. Stashing Changes

Issue: You need to switch branches but have uncommitted changes.

Solution:
```sh
git stash
git checkout <branch_name>
````
Later, you can apply the stashed changes:
```sh
git stash apply
```

### 7. Removing a File from a Commit

Issue: You accidentally committed a file and want to remove it from the commit.

Solution:
```sh
git reset HEAD~1
git rm --cached <file_name>
git commit --amend -C HEAD
git push -f
```

This sequence removes the file from the commit and updates the commit.

### 8. Force Pushing

Issue: You need to force push changes to a remote branch.

Solution:
```sh
git push origin <branch_name> --force
```
Note: Force pushing can overwrite changes in the remote repository. Use it with caution.

### 9. Rebasing vs. Merging

Issue: You need to decide between rebasing and merging.

Solution:

Merging: Combines two branches, preserving the commit history.
```sh
git merge <branch_name>
```
Rebasing: Re-applies commits from one branch onto another, creating a linear history.

```sh
git rebase <branch_name>
```

Note: Rebasing can rewrite commit history. Use it carefully, especially with shared branches.

### 10. Ignoring Files

Issue: You want to ignore certain files or directories.

Solution:

Add the files or directories to a .gitignore file.

```plaintext
# .gitignore
/node_modules
*.log
```
